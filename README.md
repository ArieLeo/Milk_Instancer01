# Milk_Instancer01
 GPU instancing in unity with occlusion culling, frustum culling, and LODs
 
 warning: this is like super early early alpha. if you happened to come across this by chance please check back later, some things are still broken in a few ways and this is by no means feature complete. I am still working on this and it will be updated as I improve the system
 
 also im still setting up the readme

 This project is a vastly improved version of elliomans indirect rendering with compute shaders. https://github.com/ellioman/Indirect-Rendering-With-Compute-Shaders
 
 What is different in this version?
  - gpu bitonic sorting is now no longer reliant on powers of two (thanks to EmmetOT - https://github.com/EmmetOT/BufferSorter)
  - improved user interface
  - instances can now be painted into the scene, much like unitys terrain detail system
  - this version works in HDRP
  - amplify shader editor examples
  - wind shader example
  - bruh
  - ...

 What more is there to do?
  - FIX BUGS
  - instance density control
  - URP shaders
  - more spawning methods, perhaps procedural spawning
  - create a user friendly interface
  - ...

 Project info:
  - created on unity 2021.2.1f1 HDRP 12.1.0
