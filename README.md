  - gpu bitonic sorting is now no longer reliant on powers of two (thanks to EmmetOT - https://github.com/EmmetOT/BufferSorter)
  - improved user interface
  - instances can now be painted into the scene, much like unitys terrain detail system
  - this version works in HDRP
  - amplify shader editor examples
