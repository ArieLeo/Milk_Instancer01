 This project is a vastly improved version of elliomans indirect rendering with compute shaders. https://github.com/ellioman/Indirect-Rendering-With-Compute-Shaders
 
 What is different in this version?
  - gpu bitonic sorting is now no longer reliant on powers of two (thanks to EmmetOT - https://github.com/EmmetOT/BufferSorter)
  - improved user interface
  - instances can now be painted into the scene, much like unitys terrain detail system
  - this version works in HDRP
  - amplify shader editor examples
  - wind shader example

Features
  - HDRP instancing
  - instance density control
  - paint prefabs on any object
  - multiple prefab support
  - per-instance occlusion culling
  - frustum culling
  - up to 3 LODs
  - Amplify Shader Editor examples
  - ShaderGraph examples
  - wind shader example (ASE and SG)
  - Multi-Material Prefab support (for things like trees)
  - world streaming/detail zones


 What am I still working on?
  - find and fix bugs
  - URP shaders
  - more spawning methods, perhaps procedural terrain spawning
  - built in renderer support
  - idk im sure ill think of something

 Project info:
  - created on unity 2021.2.7f1 HDRP 12.1.0 (tested as low as HDRP 10)

if you find this project useful to you in any way, even if for just the wind system and not the GPU instancing, feel free to leave it a star, or subscribe to my youtube. it helps me out alot! https://www.youtube.com/c/MilkDrinker01
